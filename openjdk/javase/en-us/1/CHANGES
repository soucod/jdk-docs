Changes from JDK 1.1.4 to JDK 1.1.5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

JDK 1.1.5 is a bug-fix release. The following list summarizes some 
significant changes in JDK 1.1.5.

______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1.5".

_________________
AWT SCROLLBAR BUG - In some situations, the scrollbar would not 
stop scrolling on earlier versions of JDK 1.1 for Solaris-SPARC. This 
problem has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. [Bug 4048060]

______________
AWT CHOICE BUG - In earlier versions of the JDK, Choice.removeAll() 
followed by Choice.addItem would result in a core dump in some 
situations. This problem has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. [Bug 4064823]

__________
SOCKET BUG - On win95, under certain circumstances such as heavy 
network load, closing sockets could cause the connection to be reset, 
disturbing the connection's peer. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.
[Bug 4069782]

________________ 
APPLETVIEWER BUG - In earlier JDKs, the appletviewer would hang while 
running under jdb. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. [Bug 4061955]

________________
MODAL DIALOG BUG - Hiding and then showing modal dialogs resulted in 
crash-causing race conditions in earlier JDKs. This bug has been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.5. [Bug 4068620]

_____________________________
AWT LIGHTWEIGHT COMPONENT BUG - In a FOCUS_GAINED handler for a 
lightweight component, a call to requestFocus() to shift the focus to 
another view would fail. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. 
[Bug 4070597]

_________________________________
ARRAY INITIALIZATION OPTIMIZATION - Beginning with JDK 1.1.5, the 
compiler does not generate inline code to fill the values of newly 
created arrays, because such arrays are already filled with the 
default values. This optimization saves half a megabyte in the 
compressed classes.zip file.  [Bugs 4017848, 4080908]

_______________
AWT REPAINT BUG - When several repaints are issued together in 
previous JDKs, some repaints would not be carried out. This problem 
has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4073091]

_______________
AWT THREADS BUG - Repeatedly adding and removing components using 
threads sometimes caused the VM to crash in earlier JDKs. This bug 
has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4073623] 

________________
JAVA.NET.URL BUG - In JDK 1.1.4, the method setURLStreamHandlerFactory 
in java.net.url did not clear the handlers cache. This meant that any 
URL constructed prior to calling that method would use an old handler. 
This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4074245]

_________________________
GETRESOURCE DIRECTORY BUG - JDK 1.1.4 introduced a bug in which a 
directory path (e.g. myImages/) would be used to obtain a URL via 
getResource().  This bug was only present on the win32 platform, and 
was present in some conditions when using Beans.instantiate(). This bug 
has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5 [Bug 4080478]

_______________
GETRESOURCE BUG - In JDK 1.1.4, the URL returned by getResource() was 
incorrect. This problem has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5 [Bug 4026780].  
For details on getResource() and getResourceAsStream() see the document 
at http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/misc/resources.html.

_____________
AWT EVENT BUG - In JDK 1.1.4, when the mouse was moved from a 
lightweight component directly to a non-lightweight component, a 
MouseMove event was not generated to the host container. This bug has 
been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4065565]

_____________
AWT PANEL BUG - In JDK 1.1.4, components derived from Panel had an 
extra pixel in their border. Among other things, this could cause 
problems with calculation of BorderLayout element heights. This 
bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bugs 4062779, 4064468]

_______________
AWT MENUBAR BUG - On Solaris versions of JDK 1.1.4, the MenuBar was 
not always correctly resized when MenuBar labels changed length. This 
problem has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4071628]

_______________
AWT MENUBAR BUG - On Windows versions of JDK 1.1.4, a MenuBar did 
not correctly resize itself when all items were removed from it and 
new items added to it. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. 
[Bug 4071438]

_____________
AWT EVENT BUG - On Windows versions of JDK 1.1.4, spurious mouse press 
events were sometimes generated during mouse exit events. This bug has 
been fixed in JDK 1.1.5.  [Bug 4038721]

________________
AWT PRINTJOB BUG - In earlier JDKs, java.awt.PrintJob.getPageResolution 
and java.awt.PrintJob.GetPageDimension would return incorrect values in 
some circumstances. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.5. [Bug 4049865]


=======================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1.3 to JDK 1.1.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

JDK 1.1.4 is a bug-fix release. The following list summarizes some 
significant changes in JDK 1.1.4.
______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1.4".

____________________
JAVA TEXT BOUNDS BUG - The DateFormat.parse() unexpectedly threw a 
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException rather than the expected 
FormatException.  This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4031620]

_________________
AWT COMPONENT BUG - In the Windows version of JDK 1.1.3, incorrect 
character codes from non-101 keyboards where being received, causing 
the incorrect generation of a KeyPressed/Release event.  This bug has 
been fixed in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bugs 4051910, 4053800]

__________________
AWT POPUP MENU BUG - Removing menus from PopupMenus on Solaris versions 
of JDK 1.1.2 and JDK 1.1.3 caused a core dump. This problem has been 
corrected in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4054479]

__________
AWT IM BUG - In the Solaris version on the JDK 1.1.1, the IM status 
region was created inside of the AWT window and broke the layout of the 
window.  This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4041569]

____________
AWT MENU BUG - In the Solaris version of the JDK 1.1.2 & JDK 1.1.3 a 
core dump would result when removing MenuItems from submenus on 
PopuMenus.  This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4054479]

____________________
AWT MODAL DIALOG BUG - Calls to the hide() method in the Win32 version 
of JDK 1.1.3 does not always hide the modal dialog.  This is a 
regression from JDK 1.1.1.  This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.4 
[Bug 4068651]

______________
AWT CURSOR BUG - In JDK 1.1.3, Frame.setCursor sometimes didn't update 
the cursor until the user moved the mouse. This bug has been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4040388]

___________________
AWT KEYBOARD EVENTS - Caps lock and Shift keyboard events did not 
work properly on Win32 versions of JDK 1.1.3. This problem has been 
fixed in JDK 1.1.4. [Bug 4067542]

_________________________
AWT WINDOW ACTIVATION BUG - In JDK 1.1.3, invisible windows could not 
be activated, which caused applets to hang. This bug has been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4068536]

_____________________
AWT COLOR SUPPORT BUG - Previous versions of JDK 1.1 did not correctly 
handle 8-bit TrueColor. This problem has been corrected in JDK 1.1.4.
[Bug 4061285]

_______
JNI BUG - In JDK 1.1.4, the JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs function has 
been corrected to properly set the default system class path. In 
previous versions of the JDK, the default system class path was set to 
NULL.

________________
LOCALIZATION BUG - In the zh_TW.BIG5 locale, users could not input 
Chinese characters into the text area. This problem has been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bug 4053637]

____________________
java INTERPRETER BUG - In previous releases of JDK 1.1, the java 
interpreter would allow the class file at /a/b/c.class to be invoked 
from within the /a/b directory by the command "java c", even if the 
class c was in package a.b.*. This behavior is incorrect and has been 
fixed in JDK 1.1.4. In JDK 1.1.4, the fully qualified class name must 
be specified. For example, to invoke the class a.b.c at /a/b/c.class, 
the command "java a.b.c" could be issued from the parent directory of 
directory /a.

_________________
jdb DEBUGGER BUGS - Several Java debugger problems are fixed in JDK 
1.1.4. In previous JDKs, the debugger could not print a static member 
whose type was a string. Setting a breakpoint in a native method would 
cause the debugger to crash. These debugger problems have been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.4.  [Bugs 4064129, 4062582]


=======================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1.2 to JDK 1.1.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

JDK 1.1.3 is a bug-fix release to correct a localization problem in 
the Solaris JDK 1.1.2. The following list summarizes changes in 
JDK 1.1.3.
______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1.3".

________________
LOCALIZATION BUG - In Solaris versions of JDK 1.1.2, the mechanism 
for loading the ByteToCharConverter classes for non-8859_1 encodings 
was broken. Characters in text areas of windows did not display 
properly for non-English-language locales and non-Western European 
locales. This problem did not exist in JDK 1.1.1. This bug has been 
fixed in JDK 1.1.3.  [Bugs 4049223, 4055084]

___________________________
VERIFIER IMPLEMENTATION BUG - A bug in the JDK 1.1.2 verifier would 
allow a type-unsafe applet to search and locate strings stored in the 
browser's address space. This bug is not known to be present in 
JDK 1.0.x. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.3. [Bug 4059597]

______________ 
JAVA BEANS BUG - The method java.beans.BeanInfo.getMethodDescriptors() 
did not return MethodDescriptors for all externally visible methods 
in some situations. getMethodDescriptors() did not report methods 
having no arguments when those methods were defined later in a class 
than similarly named methods having arguments. This problem did not 
exist in JDK 1.1.1. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.3. [Bug 4056837]

_______________
AWT REPAINT BUG - Synchronization problems with graphics in the 
Win32 version of JDK 1.1.2 would cause graphics deadlocks or 
crashes of the Java virtual machine in some situations. This problem 
did not exist in JDK 1.1.1. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.3.
[Bugs 4049421, 4051303]

________________
java_g -prof BUG - The profiling option of the Java interpreter 
did not work in the Win32 version of JDK 1.1.2. Using a command
such as    C:\> java_g -prof MyClass     would cause the Java 
virtual machine to crash. This problem did not exist in JDK 1.1.1. 
This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.3. [Bug 4056944]

_______________________
AWT FONTMETRICS SPEEDUP - Improvements have been made to AWT font 
metrics in JDK 1.1.3, resulting in significant speedups for programs 
such as HotJava that rely heavily on text rendering. 
[Bug 4046795]

_________________
AWT COMPONENT BUG - In the Windows version of JDK 1.1.2, a race 
condition sometimes caused the HotJava browser to crash when disposing 
components that were in the process of being shown. This bug has 
been fixed in JDK 1.1.3.  [Bug 4051487]

________________
AWT GRAPHICS BUG - In the Windows version of JDK 1.1.2, multi-
threaded access to Graphics objects sometimes resulted in dangling 
pointers due to a race condition in awt_Graphics.cpp. This bug has 
been fixed in JDK 1.1.3. [Bug 4049421]

________________
INPUT STREAM BUG - An InputStreamReader using the UTF8 encoding 
produced an erroneous character stream with missing characters. 
This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.3  [Bug 4059684]


=======================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1.1 to JDK 1.1.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

JDK 1.1.2 is a bug-fix release. The following is a list of important 
bug fixes and other changes in JDK 1.1.2.
______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1.2".

____________
VERIFIER BUG - The JDK 1.1.1 bytecode verifier did not check to 
determine whether the number of arguments passed into a method is less 
than the amount of memory allocated to local variables for that 
method. There was no known security attack based on this bug. This bug 
has been corrected in JDK 1.1.2.

___________
SIGNING BUG - In JDK 1.1.1, digitally signed code could be 
manipulated to impersonate another digital signature from the list of 
signers that are recorded in the Java runtime. This bug has been 
fixed in JDK 1.1.2. [Bug 4048143]

_______
DSA BUG - In JDK 1.1.1, the same default seed was used for every 
invocation of DSA. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.2. 
[Bug 4050406]

________________
AWT MENU BUG FIX - Trying to add a pull-right cascade menu to a 
PopupMenu in JDK 1.1.1 led to an exception. This problem did not 
exist in JDK 1.1. This bug has been corrected in JDK 1.1.2.
[Bug 4039089]

_________________________________
AWT LIGHTWEIGHT COMPONENT BUG FIX - Mouse tracking events for 
lightweight components were not being delivered in some situations. 
This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.2.  [Bug 4038897]

___________________
AWT REPAINT BUG FIX - Some components were not being repainted 
properly in some situations in JDK 1.1.1. This problem did not 
exist in JDK 1.1. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.2.
[Bug 4040638]

__________________
AWT DIALOG BUG FIX - Closing nested modal dialogs out of order would 
cause parent to remain disabled in some cases. This bug has been fixed 
in JDK1.1.2.  [Bug 4045610]

_________________
AWT FOCUS BUG FIX - Setting default focus caused applets to hang in 
some situations. This problem did not exist in JDK 1.1. This bug 
has been fixed in JDK 1.1.2.  [Bug 4038896]

____________________
APPLETVIEWER BUG FIX - Trying to save an applet from the Appletviewer 
led to an exception. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.1.2.
[Bug 4036537]

________________
DEBUGGER BUG FIX - The debugger "dump" command converted double 
values to float values before displaying them. This bug has been fixed 
in JDK 1.1.2.  [Bug 4046775]

_______________
JAVADOC BUG FIX - The javadoc html output for interfaces repeated 
the word "interface" in the signature. This bug has been fixed in 
JDK 1.1.2.  [Bug 4041579]

__________________________
JNI INVOCATION API CHANGES - To better support the JRE, the 
Invocation API is extended in JDK 1.1.2 in a few minor ways. 
The changes do not break any existing code. The JNI Native 
Method Interface has not been changed. 

1. The reserved0 field in the JDK1_1InitArgs structure has been
renamed to "version." The JDK1_1InitArgs structure holds the
initialization arguments to JNI_CreateJavaVM. Callers of 
JNI_CreateJavaVM must set the version field to 0x00010001. 
JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs has been changed to return a "jint" 
indicating whether the requested version is supported.

2. The reserved1 field in the JDK1_1InitArgs structure has been
renamed to "properties." This is a NULL-terminated array of 
strings. Each string has the format:

			name=value

indicating a system property. (This facility corresponds to the -D
option in the java command line.)
 
3. In JDK 1.1.1, the thread calling DestroyJavaVM must be the only
user thread in the VM. JDK 1.1.2 has lifted this restriction. If
DestroyJavaVM is called when there is more than one user thread,
the VM waits until the current thread is the only user thread, and
then tries to destroy itself.

_________________________
NEW jre COMMAND-LINE TOOL - The jre command-line tool is similar to 
the java command-line tool, but is intended primarily for end users 
who do not require the development-related options available with 
the java tool. For more information on the jre tool, see 
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jre.html
or http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/tooldocs/win32/jre.html. 
Source code for the jre tool can be found in the Windows JDK 1.1.2 
directory tree in the jdk1.1.2\demo\jre\win32 folder. In the 
Solaris JDK 1.1.2, jre source files can be found in the 
jdk1.1.2/demo/jre/solaris directory.


=======================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1_Final to JDK 1.1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes and bug fixes are in the JDK 1.1.1 final release.
This is a bug fix release.
______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1.1". 

_________
BUG FIXES - This version contains the bug fixes listed at the 
    web page mentioned above. 

____________
UTIL BUG FIX - Removed getMenu and getMenuBar methods from 
    util.ResourceBundle class. [Bug 4036076]

    This bug fix is mentioned here because it fixes an API bug
    in JDK 1.1.

    These two "convenience" methods were part of the beta release
    and were mistakenly left in the final JDK 1.1 after we
    discovered the design weakness they presented and decided to
    remove them.  It is a bug that they were included in the 1.1
    release, and you should not call these methods.   We have 
    removed them in 1.1.1.  Being convenience methods, they are not 
    essential, and alternate coding is simple.   

    To be more specific, the ResourceBundle class in JDK 1.1 
    included the two methods:

    public final Menu getMenu(String key) 
        throws MissingResourceException {
             return (Menu) getObject(key);
         }
 
     public final MenuBar getMenuBar(String key) 
        throws MissingResourceException {
             return (MenuBar) getObject(key);
     }

    These "convenience" methods saved the user from having to
    explicitly cast objects in a ResourceBundle that happened to 
    be of type Menu or MenuBar, such as:
    
       (Menu)rb.getObject(key)
    
    The side effect was that by returning types Menu and MenuBar, this 
    class referred to the awt package.  ResourceBundle is a relatively 
    low level piece of the core however while AWT is a relatively high 
    level piece. This dependency caused a number of problems.  Most 
    notably it did not allow a Java runtime environment to be created 
    that omitted the AWT package (such as in a server).
    
    Removing this dependency on AWT required removing these APIs 
    completely from ResourceBundle.  This change, of course, breaks 
    code that calls these methods.  The upside is that these two APIs 
    were of very little marginal value.  They simply saved the user 
    the effort of typing an explicit cast. Furthermore, since these
    two methods were new at 1.1, they have not been available for
    very long. 

_____________________
AWT COMPONENT BUG FIX - Changed the field java.awt.Component.locale
    from protected to private.  

    The locale field is accessible through getLocale() and 
    setLocale() methods, and all code should be using those.  
    This change is necessary to support future development of 
    the lightweight framework.
 
________________________
AWT DATATRANSFER BUG FIX - Corrected the MIME type for DataFlavor.
    [Bug 4037854]

    In JDK 1.1, java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor used the wrong MIME
    type.  DataFlavor claimed that the MIME type for a java 
    serialized object was: 

       application/x-javaserializedobject 

    This name is inconsistent with other existing names and common
    conventions. The name has been corrected by adding hypens to it, 
    as follows:

       application/x-java-serialized-object 

    This makes it consistent with: 

       application/java-vm 
       application/x-java-vm 
       application/x-java-archive 

____________
FONT CHANGES - Times, Helvetica, and Courier are now mapped to
    Latin1 characters.

    Times, Helvetica, and Courier fonts are no longer mapped to 
    non-Latin1 classes of fonts, such as Symbol or ZapfDingabats.
    These three fonts are now mapped to Latin1 characters, just like
    they were in version 1.0.

    If you want to have non-Latin1 characters, you must map fonts
    such as Symbol and ZapfDingabats to the Java virtual fonts.  These
    virtual font classes are Serif, Sans-serif, Monospaced, Dialog, 
    and DialogInput.
	

===================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1beta3 to JDK 1.1_Final
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes and bug fixes are in the JDK 1.1 final release.

______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1_Final". 
    Throughout the documentation we call it simply "JDK1.1"

____________
TEXT CHANGES - Extensive surface changes to Text package

    The following extensive changes in the Text package are the
    result of a design review recently carried out to
    simplify, rationalize and properly abstract the 
    internationalization API.  We realized this would 
    make a significant improvement in learning and using 
    internationalization in Java.  
 
    The changes involve mostly surface changes, such as 
    renaming and moving API, and changing the order of arguments,
    to better conform with conventions established with the rest
    of Java.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - CharacterIterator

    Removed getText method. CharacterIterators are intended to allow 
character
    at a time access to text without exposing how the text is actually 
stored.
    It is expected that some CharacterIterators will operate on text 
that can
    not easily or efficiently be stored as a String. Accessing the text 
as a
    whole should be the responsibility of the text object.

    Rename startIndex to getBeginIndex and rename endIndex to
    getEndIndex. This is to follow established naming patterns for 
getters and
    setters as well as java.lang.String's convention for identifying 
ranges in
    text.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - ChoiceFormat

    Changed the constructor to take an array of Strings rather than an 
array
    of Objects.  String were the only type that made sense in this 
context.

    Changed the setChoices method to take an array of Strings rather 
than an
    array of Objects.  String were the only type that made sense in 
this
    context.  

    Added applyPattern and toPattern methods similar to the methods on 
other 
    Format classes.

    Changed the format methods to take a FieldPosition rather than a
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parse method to take a ParsePosition rather than a 
ParseStatus
    argument. See the change description for ParseStatus.
    
    Added clone, hashCode and equals methods.  These are standard 
overrides
    and do not change the semantics.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - Collation

    Renamed class "Collator".  It was not clear from the old name 
whether this
    class actually did collation or simply represented a set of 
collation
    rules.  The new name makes it clear that the class performs string
    comparisons.
    
    Removed the constants LESS, EQUAL and GREATER. Changed the compare 
methods
    to return the int value -1, 0 or 1 instead of LESS, EQUAL or 
GREATER. This
    follows the pattern used by the java.lang.String.compareTo method.
    
    Removed the greater and greaterOrEqual methods.  The same 
information is
    provided by the compare method.  Having only a compare and and 
equals 
    method mimics the comparison API provided by java.lang.String.
    
    Removed the compare(String, int, int, String, int, int) version of 
the
    compare method and the getSortKey(String, int, int) version of the
    getSortKey method. A recent change to String.substring makes the 
substring
    operation efficient. Users can use String.substring to specify a 
substring
    rather than requiring methods to provide substring variants. 
Slimming the
    API makes it easier to learn.
    
    Changed the type of public constants from byte to int.  Changed the
    getStrength and getDecomposition methods to return int instead of 
byte.
    Changed the setStrength and setDecomposition methods to accept int
    arguments instead of byte.  Although the byte type provides a small 
amount
    of type safety, using ints for constants is more in keeping with 
the rest
    of the JDK.  The affected constants are:
    
     byte PRIMARY = 0;                 ==>    int PRIMARY = 0;                
     byte SECONDARY = 1;               ==>    int SECONDARY = 1;              
     byte TERTIARY = 2;                ==>    int TERTIARY = 2;               
     byte IDENTICAL = 3;               ==>    int IDENTICAL = 3;              
     byte NO_DECOMPOSITION = 0;        ==>    int NO_DECOMPOSITION = 0;       
     byte CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION = 1; ==>    int 
CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION = 1;
     byte FULL_DECOMPOSITION = 2;      ==>    int FULL_DECOMPOSITION = 
2;     
    
    Removed the getDisplayName methods.  These returned the same result 
as
    the corresponding Locale.getDisplayName method calls.  Until we 
have more
    useful data, its better not to have these methods in the API.
    
    Provided a concrete equals method.  This allows sub-classes to 
correctly
    implement the equals method.
    
    Renamed getSortKey method to getCollationKey.  See the change 
description
    for getSortKey.
    
    Renamed getDefault methods to getInstance.  This follows new naming 
pattern
    for factory methods.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - CollatedString

    Removed this class.  Its purpose was to associate a String with its
    CollationKey. CollationKey has been changed retain a reference to 
the 
    String it was generated from.  This allows us to reduce the size of 
the 
    API.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - CollationElementIterator

    Removed the public constructor. CollationElementIterators are 
created by
    RuleBasedCollator objects.  This was expressed by handing a
    RuleBasedCollator object to the constructor.  This connection is 
more
    obvious if the CollationElementIterator can only be created by a 
factory
    method on RuleBasedCollator.

    Made the values returned by the next method directly comparable.  
This is
    not an API change but a semantic change for the next method.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - DateFormat

    Made the constructor protected.  DateFormat is an abstract class so 
it
    doesn't need a public constructor.
    
    Removed the getDisplayName methods.  These returned the same result 
as
    the corresponding Locale.getDisplayName method calls.  Until we 
have more
    useful data, its better not to have these methods in the API.
    
    Added a style called MEDIUM that does what DEFAULT does now. For 
this
    release, MEDIUM and DEFAULT have the same effect.  In future, the 
meaning 
    of DEFAULT will be determined from the locale data. This is a more 
    logical organization of the style choices.
    
    Changed the format methods to take a FieldPosition rather than a
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parse and parseObject methods to take a ParsePosition 
rather
    than a ParseStatus argument. See the change description for 
ParseStatus.
    
    Renamed the getTimeFormat methods to getTimeInstance.  Renamed the
    getDateFormat methods to getDateInstance.  Renamed the 
getDateTimeFormat
    methods to getDateTimeInstance.  This follows new naming pattern
    for factory methods.
    
    Added a getInstance() factory method that does the same thing as
    getDateTimeFormat(SHORT,SHORT) previously did. This follows the 
pattern 
    for factories which provides for a getInstance() that returns a 
default 
    value to be always available.
    
    Renamed getValidationMode to isLenient.  Renamed setValidationMode 
to
    setLenient. These names are more descriptive.
    
    Change the type of public constants from byte to int.  Although the 
byte
    type provides a small amount of type safety, using ints for 
constants is
    more in keeping with the rest of the JDK. Also rename constants to 
follow
    the naming convention uses by JDK.  The results are:
    
     byte ERA_FIELD = 0;               ==> int ERA_FIELD = 0;
     byte YEAR_FIELD = 1;              ==> int YEAR_FIELD = 1;
     byte MONTH_FIELD = 2;             ==> int MONTH_FIELD = 2;
     byte DATE_FIELD = 3;              ==> int DATE_FIELD = 3;
     byte HOUROFDAY1_FIELD = 4;        ==> int HOUR_OF_DAY1_FIELD = 4;
     byte HOUROFDAY0_FIELD = 5;        ==> int HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD = 5;
     byte MINUTE_FIELD = 6;            ==> int MINUTE_FIELD = 6;
     byte SECOND_FIELD = 7;            ==> int SECOND_FIELD = 7;
     byte MILLISECOND_FIELD = 8;       ==> int MILLISECOND_FIELD = 8;
     byte DAYOFWEEK_FIELD = 9;         ==> int DAY_OF_WEEK_FIELD = 9;
     byte DAYOFYEAR_FIELD = 10;        ==> int DAY_OF_YEAR_FIELD = 10;
     byte DAYOFWEEKINMONTH_FIELD = 11; ==> int 
DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH_FIELD = 11;
     byte WEEKOFYEAR_FIELD = 12;       ==> int WEEK_OF_YEAR_FIELD = 12;
     byte WEEKOFMONTH_FIELD = 13;      ==> int WEEK_OF_MONTH_FIELD = 
13;
     byte AMPM_FIELD = 14;             ==> int AM_PM_FIELD = 14;
     byte HOUR1_FIELD = 15;            ==> int HOUR1_FIELD = 15;
     byte HOUR0_FIELD = 16;            ==> int HOUR0_FIELD = 16;
     byte TIMEZONE_FIELD = 17;         ==> int TIMEZONE_FIELD = 17;
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - DateFormatData

    Renamed class to DateFormatSymbols.  This makes its purpose as a 
set of
    strings and symbols to be used in formatting clearer.
    
    Removed the millisPerHour protected field.  This was not an 
appropriate
    field in a collection of formatting symbols.
    
    Renamed getAmpms to getAmPmStrings.  Renamed setAmpms to 
setAmPmStrings. 
    The new names follow the capitalization standard and are clearer.
    
    Removed methods useLocalizedPattern and setPatternLocalized.  This
    functionality can be obtained through the toLocalizedPattern and
    applyLocalizedPattern methods of SimpleDateFormat. These methods 
were not
    appropriate in a collection of formatting symbols.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - DecimalFormat

    Renamed getThousandsInterval and setThousandsInterval methods to
    getGroupingSize and setGroupingSize.  The new names are clearer.
    
    Renamed getFactor and setFactor methods to getMultiplier and 
setMultiplier.
    The new names are clearer.
    
    Changed the constructor that takes a NumberFormatData to use a
    DecimalFormatSymbols object instead. See the change description for
    NumberFormatData. 
    
    Added a constructor that takes just a String and figures out the 
correct
    DecimalFormatSymbols for the default locale.  This fills in the 
telescope
    pattern for constructors.
    
    Renamed getPattern method to toPattern. Also removed the boolean 
argument
    and instead added a toLocalizedPattern method. The new name better
    reflects the fact that there is no "pattern" property, but rather a
    pattern string is constructed that matches the current state of the
    DecimalFormat object. Splitting the method into two allows many 
users to
    ignore the existence of toLocalizedPattern.
    
    Renamed setPattern method to applyPattern. Also removed the boolean 
    argument and instead added an applyLocalizedPattern method. The new 
    name better reflects the fact that there is no "pattern" property, 
    but rather a pattern string is used to set the state of the 
DecimalFormat 
    object. Splitting the method into two allows many users to ignore 
the 
    existence of applyLocalizedPattern.
    
    Removed the "*" and "_" characters from the pattern syntax.  This 
is not
    strictly an api change but it is a semantic change.  These 
characters were
    of limited use the way they were implemented.
    
    Changed the format methods to take a FieldPosition rather than a
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parse method to take a ParsePosition rather than a
    ParseStatus argument. See the change description for ParseStatus.
    
    Renamed getNumberFormatData to getDecimalFormatSymbols and changed 
its
    return type to DecimalFormatSymbols.  Renamed setNumberFormatData 
to
    setDecimalFormatSymbols and changed its argument type to
    DecimalFormatSymbols.  See the change description for 
NumberFormatData.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - Format
    
    Changed the format method to take a FieldPosition rather than a 
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parseObject method to take a ParsePosition rather than 
a
    ParseStatus argument. See the change description for ParseStatus.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - FormatException

    Renamed class to ParseException.  This better reflects its purpose.
    
    Removed the no argument constructor.  This constructor was not 
useful.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - FormatStatus

    Renamed class to FieldPosition.  This better reflects its purpose 
as an
    object which describes where sub-fields are located in a formatted 
string.
    
    Replaced public integer fields with getter methods.  Adjusted names 
to
    match pattern for indicating ranges in text.  The result:
    
     int alignField   ==> int getField()
     int alignStart   ==> int getBeginIndex()
     int alignEnd     ==> int getEndIndex()
    
    Replaced no argument constructor with a constructor that sets the 
field.
    A field value must always be set so this prevents invalid objects.  
    It is also more convenient than doing it in two steps.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - MessageFormat

    Redesigned the syntax for message patterns to allow inlining of 
other
    pattern strings, such as date patterns, number patterns, choice 
patterns
    etc. This is not itself an API change but is a big semantic 
difference.
    This change allows complete message formats to be created in fewer 
steps.

    Removed the constructor that took a String and a Format array.  
This was
    not needed with the new inline pattern syntax.

    Added a setFormat method which allows a single format to be set at 
a time
    rather than requiring all formats to be specified like the 
setFormats
    method. This is more convenient given the inline pattern syntax.

    Removed the format method that took a String, a Format array and an 
Object
    array.  It was not necessary with the new inline pattern syntax.

    Changed the parse method that takes a single String argument to 
return an
    array of Objects rather than a single Object.  This makes more 
sense given
    the fact that a message may have many objects embedded in it.
    
    Changed the format methods to take a FieldPosition rather than a
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parse method to take a ParsePosition rather than a 
ParseStatus
    argument. See the change description for ParseStatus.
    
    Renamed getPattern method to toPattern. The new name better 
reflects the
    fact that there is no "pattern" property. Rather a pattern string 
is
    constructed that matches the current state of the MessageFormat 
object.
    
    Renamed setPattern method to applyPattern. The new name better 
reflects
    the fact that there is no "pattern" property. Rather a pattern 
string is
    used to set the state of the MessageFormat object.

    Added setLocale and getLocale methods.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - NumberFormat

    Renamed getDefaultCurrency to getCurrencyInstance.  Renamed
    getDefaultPercent to getPercentInstance.  Added a getNumberInstance
    factory.  Rename getDefault to getInstance.  This follows the 
naming
    pattern for factories.
    
    Removed getCurrencySymbol and getIntlCurrencySymbol methods. These 
will be
    added to a more appropriate class in a future release.
    
    In the methods called 
{get|set}{Minimum|Maximum}{Integer|Decimal}Count,
    rename the word Count to Digits and the word Decimal to Fraction.  
These
    names are clearer.
    
    Remove the methods isDecimalUsedWithInteger and
    setDecimalUsedWithInteger. These methods are now found in 
DecimalFormat
    under the names isDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown
    setDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown.
    
    Renamed setIntegerOnly to setParseIntegerOnly. Renamed 
isIntegerOnly to
    isParseIntegerOnly.
    
    Renamed {is|set}ThousandsUsed to {is|set}GroupingUsed.
    
    Removed the getDisplayName methods.  These returned the same result 
as
    the corresponding Locale.getDisplayName method calls.  Until we 
have more
    useful data, its better not to have these methods in the API.
    
    Renamed DECIMAL_FIELD to FRACTION_FIELD. Also changed its type from 
byte
    to int. This name is more general. Use of ints as constants is 
standard
    practice.
    
    Removed NUMERATOR_FIELD, DENOMINATOR_FIELD and EXPONENT_FIELD. This
    functionality was not supported in this release.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - NumberFormatData

    Renamed class DecimalFormatSymbols. This makes its purpose as a set 
of
    strings and symbols to be used in formatting clearer.
    
    Added a default constructor which constructs an object suitable for 
the
    default locale.  Added a constructor which takes a locale.  These 
follow 
    the pattern set by DateFormatSymbols.
    
    Removed starDigit, spaceDigit and exponential fields.  This 
functionality 
    is not being supported by DecimalFormat.
    
    Changed public fields to getter/setter methods.  Adjusted the names 
of the
    methods for clarity.  The results are:
    
     char zeroDigit;         ==> getZeroDigit(), setZeroDigit()        
     char thousandsSign;     ==> getGroupingSeparator(), 
setGroupingSeparator()
     char decimalSign;       ==> getDecimalSeparator(), 
setDecimalSeparator()
     char millePercent;      ==> getPerMill(), setPerMill()               
     char percent;           ==> getPercent(), setPercent()               
     char digit;             ==> getDigit(), setDigit()               
     char separator;         ==> getPatternSeparator(), 
setPatternSeparator() 
     java.lang.String infinity; ==> getInfinity(), setInfinity()    
     java.lang.String nan;   ==> getNaN(), setNaN()
     char minusSign;         ==> getMinusSign(), setMinusSign()    
    
    Removed the static final char fields.  These were not appropriate 
for a
    collection of locale specific number formatting fields.  They were 
also 
    of little use outside the implementation of DecimalFormat. The 
removed 
    fields are:
    
     static final char patternZeroDigit = 48;
     static final char patternThousandsSign =
     static final char patternDecimalSign = 4
     static final char patternMillePercent = 
     static final char patternPercent = 37;  
     static final char patternDigit = 35;    
     static final char patternStarDigit = 42;
     static final char patternSpaceDigit = 95
     static final char patternSeparator = 59;

____________
TEXT CHANGES - ParseStatus

    Renamed class ParsePosition.  This better reflects its purpose as 
an object
    which shows where parsing starts and stops.
    
    Removed no argument constructor. This was redundant and of no real
    convenience.
    
    Changed public field startAt to a getter/setter method pair.  Also
    adjusted names of the methods to suit the naming pattern for 
indicating
    characters in a String.  The results:
    
      startAt   ==> getIndex(), setIndex()

____________
TEXT CHANGES - SimpleDateFormat

    Changed the format method to take a FieldPosition rather than a 
    FormatStatus argument. See the change description for FormatStatus.
    
    Changed the parse method to take a ParsePosition rather than a 
ParseStatus
    argument. See the change description for ParseStatus.
    
    Changed the constructor which took a DateFormatData object to use a
    DateFormatSymbols object instead.  See the change description for
    DateFormatData.
    
    Renamed getDateFormatData and setDateFormatData to 
getDateFormatSymbols 
    and setDateFormatSymbols. See the change description for 
DateFormatData.
    
    Renamed getPattern method to toPattern. Also removed the boolean 
argument 
    and instead added a toLocalizedPattern method. The new name better 
    reflects the fact that there is no "pattern" property, but rather a 
    pattern string is constructed that matches the current state of the 
    DecimalFormat object. Splitting the method into two allows many 
users 
    to ignore the existence of toLocalizedPattern.
    
    Renamed setPattern method to applyPattern. Also removed the boolean 
    argument and instead added an applyLocalizedPattern method. The new 
    name better reflects the fact that there is no "pattern" property, 
but 
    rather a pattern string is used to set the state of the 
DecimalFormat 
    object. Splitting the method into two allows many users to ignore 
the 
    existence of applyLocalizedPattern.

    Added a convenience no argument constructor.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - SortKey

    Renamed class CollationKey.  This keeps the terminology consistent 
with
    the other collation classes.
    
    Added getSourceString method.  This returns the string that this 
    CollationKey represents. This allows the removal of the 
CollatedString 
    class.
    
    Added a toByteArray method that returns a byte[] containing the 
key. 
    
    Changed compareTo method to return int rather than byte.  This 
follows the
    pattern set by java.lang.String.compareTo.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - StringCharacterIterator

    Added the following convenience constructor:
    
      public StringCharacterIterator(String text, int begin, int end, 
int pos) 
    
    Renamed startIndex method to getBeginIndex.  Renamed endIndex 
method to
    getEndIndex. These names are consistent with the pattern for 
indicating 
    ranges in strings.
    
    Removed the getText method.  See the change description for 
    CharacterIterator.

____________
TEXT CHANGES - TableCollation

    Renamed class RuleBasedCollator.  It was not clear from the old 
name 
    whether this class actually did collation or simply represented a 
set 
    of collation rules.  The new name makes it clear that the class 
performs 
    string comparisons. It also avoids the impression that this class 
    collates tables.
    
    Renamed getSortKey method to getCollationKey.  See the change 
description 
    for SortKey. 
    
    Removed the getSortKey method that operated on a substring of a 
given 
    String.  A recent change to String.substring makes the substring 
    operation efficient. Users can use String.substring to specify a 
    substring rather than requiring methods to provide substring 
variants. 
    Slimming the API makes it easier to learn.
    
    Removed the compare method that operated on a substring of a given 
String. 
    A recent change to String.substring makes the substring operation
    efficient. Users can use String.substring to specify a substring 
rather 
    than requiring methods to provide substring variants. Slimming the 
API 
    makes it easier to learn.
    
    Changed compare to return an int value instead of a byte value.  
See 
    the change description for Collation.
    
____________
TEXT CHANGES - TextBoundary

    Renamed class to BreakIterator.  This more clearly reflects its 
purpose.
    
    Renamed method nthFromCurrent to next(int). This is a less awkward 
name.
    
    Renamed method nextAfter to following.  This is a less awkward 
name.
    
    Changed the return type of getText to CharacterIterator.  Since
    BreakIterator works in terms of a CharacterIterator it didn't make 
sense
    to return a String.
    
    Renamed getWorkBreak methods to getWordInstance.  Renamed 
getLineBreak
    methods to getLineInstance. Renamed getCharacterBreak methods to
    getCharacterInstance. Renamed getSentenceBreak methods to
    getSentenceInstance.  This follows the naming pattern for factory 
methods.

____________
UTIL CHANGES - Calendar

    Changed the type of the public constants from byte to int.  Changed 
the
    corresponding methods to accept and return ints instead of bytes.  
and
    getDecomposition methods to return int instead of byte.  Although 
the byte
    type provides a small amount of type safety, using ints for 
constants is 
    more in keeping with the rest of the JDK.  The results are:
  
     byte ERA = 0;                  ==>   int ERA = 0;                  
     byte YEAR = 1;                 ==>   int YEAR = 1;                 
     byte MONTH = 2;                ==>   int MONTH = 2;                
     byte WEEKOFYEAR = 3;           ==>   int WEEK_OF_YEAR = 3;         
     byte WEEKOFMONTH = 4;          ==>   int WEEK_OF_MONTH = 4;        
     byte DATE = 5;                 ==>   int DATE = 5;                 
     byte DAYOFMONTH = 5;           ==>   int DAY_OF_MONTH = 5;         
     byte DAYOFYEAR = 6;            ==>   int DAY_OF_YEAR = 6;          
     byte DAYOFWEEK = 7;            ==>   int DAY_OF_WEEK = 7;          
     byte DAYOFWEEKINMONTH = 8;     ==>   int DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH = 8; 
     byte AMPM = 9;                 ==>   int AM_PM = 9;                
     byte HOUR = 10;                ==>   int HOUR = 10;                
     byte HOUROFDAY = 11;           ==>   int HOUR_OF_DAY = 11;         
     byte MINUTE = 12;              ==>   int MINUTE = 12;              
     byte SECOND = 13;              ==>   int SECOND = 13;              
     byte MILLISECOND = 14;         ==>   int MILLISECOND = 14;         
     byte ZONEOFFSET = 15;          ==>   int ZONE_OFFSET = 15;         
     byte DSTOFFSET = 16;           ==>   int DST_OFFSET = 16;          
     byte FIELDCOUNT = 17;          ==>   int FIELD_COUNT = 17;         
                                           
     int get(byte);                 ==>   int get(int);
     set(byte,int);                 ==>   void set(int,int);
     void clear(byte);              ==>   void clear(int);
     void add(byte,int);            ==>   void add(int,int);     
     void roll(byte,boolean);       ==>   void roll(int,boolean);
     void setFirstDayOfWeek(byte);  ==>   void setFirstDayOfWeek(int);
     void setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(byte);
                                    ==>   void 
setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(int);
     int getMinimum(byte);          ==>   int getMinimum(int);         
     int getMaximum(byte);          ==>   int getMaximum(int);         
     int getGreatestMinimum(byte);  ==>   int getGreatestMinimum(int); 
     int getLeastMaximum(byte);     ==>   int getLeastMaximum(int);    
                                               
    
    Renamed getValidationMode to isLenient.  Renamed setValidationMode 
to
    setLenient. These names are more descriptive.
    
    Renamed the getDefault methods to getInstance.  This is in keeping 
with the
    pattern for naming factory methods.

UTIL CHANGES - GregorianCalendar

    Changed the type of the public constants from byte to int.  Changed 
the
    corresponding methods to accept and return ints instead of bytes.  
and
    getDecomposition methods to return int instead of byte.  Although 
the byte
    type provides a small amount of type safety, using ints for 
constants 
    is more in keeping with the rest of the JDK.  The results are:
     
     final byte AD = 0;           ==>      final int AD = 0; 
     final byte BC = 1;           ==>      final int BC = 1; 
    
     void add(byte,int);          ==>      void add(int,int);          
     void roll(byte,boolean);     ==>      void roll(int,boolean);       
     int getMinimum(byte);        ==>      int getMinimum(int);          
     int getMaximum(byte);        ==>      int getMaximum(int);          
     int getGreatestMinimum(byte);==>      int getGreatestMinimum(int);  
     int getLeastMaximum(byte);   ==>      int getLeastMaximum(int);     
                                     
____________
UTIL CHANGES - ResourceBundle

    Renamed getResourceBundle methods to getBundle.  The name
    getResourceBundle was too long and overly redundant.  The new name 
is not
    in keeping with the naming pattern for factory methods.  This is 
because
    the name "getInstance" is being reserved for a future addition to 
the
    resource bundle classes.
    
__________
AWT CHANGE -  Compiling programs that use old AWT API now produces
              deprecation warnings

    In the beta versions of 1.1, the deprecated methods in the AWT were
    marked with simple "DEPRECATED" strings in the method's javadoc
    comment.  For the final release we have added the appropriate
    "@deprecated" tags to those methods so that you can use the
    appropriate compiler option to generate warnings that make it
    easier for you to convert your programs when you desire to do so.

    The document at the following URL describes how to convert to the
    1.1 AWT API.  It also links to a document that lists every 
deprecated
    method and its 1.1 substitute.

    
http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/guide/awt/HowToUpgrade.html

    RATIONALE:

    The bulk of the AWT deprecations are a result of migrating the AWT
    towards JavaBeans compliance.  In particular, the two areas which
    required a significant number of deprecations were:

    - Properties (location, size, visibility, etc.)
      In order for introspection to be able to programmatically extract
      properties from AWT components, it was necessary to change the
      names of various methods to the JavaBeans getFoo/setFoo pattern.
	
    - New event model
      JavaBeans and the AWT have defined a new delegation-based event
      model for 1.1 which required significant changes to the event
      handling API.
	
    Finally, a small set of deprecated methods were changed to enhance
    the learnability and consistency of the toolkit API.

__________
AWT CHANGE -  Z-ordering changed back to 1.0.2 order
 
    For beta3, the Z-ordering for children in Container instances was
    defined in the documentation to be "back to front".  Because this
    was contrary to the default Z-ordering which existed in 1.0.2 (and
    the beta implementation), for FCS we have corrected the Z-ordering
    specification in containers to be "front to back".

__________
AWT CHANGE -  Changed names of newly-added APIs:

    The following APIs have been renamed ( from old name => to new name 
):

 	AverageScaleFilter	=>	AreaAveragingScaleFilter
 	createScaledImage(...)	=>	getScaledInstance(...)
 	SCALE_AVERAGE		=>	SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING

    RATIONALE:
    The method name was changed to "getScaledInstance(...)" to be
    consistent with the overall philosophy within the Java API where
    factories and derivative constructors should follow the naming
    convention of

		get<Flavor>Instance(...arguments...)

    The term "Average" was not descriptive of the algorithm applied by
    the default smooth scaling filter, so the name of this filter and
    its algorithm were changed to "AreaAveraging" to indicate what
    quantity was being averaged.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed dispatchEvent() method and added new method
             dispatchEventImpl()

    The codepath in dispatchEvent() really must be executed for event
    mechanics to work properly in the AWT (hence we made it 
    package-private).  We moved the implementation to a new
    package-private method (dispatchEventImpl()) and then 
    changed dispatchEvent() to be "public final" and have it
    call dispatchEventImpl() internally.

    RATIONALE:
    We have deprecated the 1.0 postEvent()/deliverEvent() methods,
    however the method that replaces those (dispatchEvent()) is
    currently package-private.  This left no options for folks
    porting to the new event model.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed capitalization of getId() to getID() in
    java.awt.AWTEvent

    Changed the method name to getID() and provided a deprecated 
version
    for compatibility with the beta versions.

    RATIONALE:
    java.awt.AWTEvent.getID() is named in a manner inconsistent with 
    the equivalent methods in other classes:
	java.awt.MediaTracker.getID()
	java.util.TimeZone.getID()
	sun.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl.getID()
	sun.rmi.transport.DGCImpl.getID()

    Developers have had trouble because they expected the naming to 
    be consistent.  This fixes bug 4027793.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed EventQueue to be non-system-specific

  The following changes were made to EventQueue:
  
  1)  Moved the static getEventQueue() method out of EventQueue
      and instead put it in Toolkit with the name 
"getSystemEventQueue()".
      Left the security check in that method, so that applets 
      cannot get access to the system queue instance (see also #3).
  
  2)  Added a public constructor to the EventQueue class such that
      multiple instances of it can be created.  This will allow 
programs
      to create and use the queue generically, as well as enable 
browser
      vendors to implement a queue/dispatch-thread-per-applet model.
  
  3)  Removed the overriding checkAwtEventQueueAccess() method in the 
      AppletSecurityManager such that it will always default to
      invoking lang.SecurityManager.checkAwtEventQueueAccess()
      and will *always* throw a security exception if an applet tries
      to get a handle on the system event queue.
  
  4)  Modified the EventQueue documentation so that it's clear that
      the class is very generic.  All references to a "system
      EventQueue" have been eliminated.

    RATIONALE:
    This allows the implementation of one dispatch thread per applet.
    It also provides design flexibility for the future.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Removed EventSource class

    Removed this class because it has no relation to the new event 
model. 

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed API for delivery of window-open and 
             window-closed events

    Moved the window event API (addWindowListener,removeWindowListener,
    etc.) from Dialog and Frame to Window (their superclass) so
    that the code is there in one place.  

    RATIONALE:
    Centralizing the code eliminates duplication and makes it easier 
    to maintain.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed return type from Transferable.getTransferData

    Transferable.getTransferData returns class BufferedInputStream.

__________
AWT CHANGE - MenuShortcut class no longer extends java.awt.Event.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed button modifier mask values in InputEvent:
		BUTTON2_MASK is now equivalent to ALT_MASK 
    		BUTTON3_MASK is now equivalent to META_MASK

    RATIONALE:
    A couple of mask constants were incorrectly defined in the
    InputEvent class.  These event masks are new in JDK1.1.
    
    This change will ensure that programs that depend on seeing the
    BUTTON1_MASK and BUTTON2_MASK will continue to work properly on
    platforms that have 1 and 2 button mice (because Alt/Meta can be
    used to generate these masks on those systems).

    This fixes bug 4029159: Button2/Button3 masks should have same 
    value as Alt/Meta in InputEvent
    
__________
AWT CHANGE - Change to serialization of AWT components

    Made a systematic change to the way JDK1.1 AWT does serialization.

    RATIONALE:
    This change corrects bug #4027305, and provides more carefully 
    thought-out and rational behaviour for AWT serialization in 
general. 

    These changes enable customers to use serialization to store
    Java Beans (in general) and to enable AWT implementations 
    to correctly interoperate between vendors.

    Implications for developers:
  
      - Saving graphs of AWT objects will now work, even if an object
        has more than one listener.
  
      - If an AWT object has listeners that are marked serializable, 
they
        will be saved and restored automatically, such as beans 
        interconnected with and saved to a file with the BeanBox. 
        Note that the BeanBox always code-generates serializable 
        listener implementations.
  	
      - If an AWT object has listeners that aren't marked serializable
        they will be dropped at writeObject() time.
  
      - Developers will need, as always, to consider the implications 
of
        making an object serializable.  One idiom to watch out for is 
        this:
  
        import java.awt.*;
        import java.awt.event.*;
        import java.io.Serializable;
  
        class MyApp implements ActionListener, Serializable
        {
          BigObjectThatShouldNotBeSeralizedWithAButton bigOne;
          Button aButton = new Button();
  
          MyApp()
          {
             // Oops, now aButton has a listener with a 
             // reference to bigOne!
             aButton.addActionListener(this);	
          }
  
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
          {
            System.out.println("Hello There");
          }
        }
  
    In this example, serializing aButton by itself will cause MyApp and
    everything it refers to to be serialized as well.  The problem
    is that the listener is serializable by coincidence, not by design.
    To separate the decisions about MyApp and the ActionListener being 
    serializable one can use an inner (nested) class, for example:
  
    import java.awt.*;
    import java.awt.event.*;
    import java.io.Serializable;
  
    class MyApp java.io.Serializable
    {
      BigObjectThatShouldNotBeSeralizedWithAButton bigOne;
      Button aButton = new Button();
  
      class MyActionListener implements ActionListener
      {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
        {
  	System.out.println("Hello There");
        }
      }
  
      MyApp()
      {
         aButton.addActionListener(new MyActionListener());
      }
    }

__________
AWT CHANGE - Added setKeyChar() method to KeyEvent

    KeyEvent had a setKeyCode() already. This new method was needed
    to copy any changes a 1.0 style program may have made
    to an Event "key".  This fix ensures that all chars work
    properly in TextFields, like hitting <return> in HotJava's URL 
field.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Changed PaintEvent class to use a rectangle for damaged 
area

    Replaced PaintEvent's "Graphics" property with a Rectangle 
    representing a damaged area instead.  

    RATIONALE:
    Although the PaintEvent class is public, its use in AWT 
    is completely private -- it is used to trigger calls to paint(), 
    but programs never explicitly see the event object at all.
 
__________
AWT CHANGE - Defined a new constant in AWTEvent:
		RESERVED_ID_MAX

    This new constant is the maximum value of any AWT-defined event ID.
    Programs that need to create their own event types should use
    an ID greater than this max ID, so that the event will be properly
    passed through the system.

    RATIONALE:
    This is part of the fix for a problem that prevented anyone from
    being able to create their own event type and send it to a
    component. 

    This fixes bug 4028353: eventEnabled returns false for all but 
    AWT events; can't send custom event types.

____________
BEANS CHANGE - Improved handling of beans that are applets

    Changed Beans.instantiate to check if a newly created or 
deserialized
    bean is an Applet.  If so, it is given a minimal AppletStub and
    AppletContext and its init method is called.
 
    After developers have added a newly instantiated bean to an AWT
    container, they should check if it is an Applet and if so call
    Applet.start.

    Also, developers need to test "wanna-be" applet/beans against
    Beans.instantiate.

____________
BEANS CHANGE - Serializable listener fix for Beans classes

    The java.beans package contains two utility classes, 
    PropertyChangeSupport and VetoableChangeSupport, that manage
    a list of event listeners.  The change was to make the way 
    these classes are serialized consistent with the AWT.

    RATIONALE
    In beta3 these two classes were inconsistent with the AWT,
    which meant there was no support for selectively saving and 
    restoring listeners marked serializable.  The changes are 
    all class private. 

_______________
SECURITY CHANGE - Key is now an interface

    Made Key an interface and updated relevant clients.  Removed all 
    implementation from Key to make it an interface. Moved its 
    implementation into sun.security.

    RATIONALE:
    Key as an interface is more flexible and easier to implement than 
    a mix of interfaces and classes.

_______________
SECURITY CHANGE - Changed names of factory methods

    Changed factory names from <Engine>.get<Engine> to get<Engine>.

    RATIONALE:
    Factory method names were MessageDigest.getMessageDigest, 
    Signature.getSignature, etc. A better naming scheme is 
Signature.get, 
    MessageDigest.get, etc. This is important when you start casting 
the 
    results to some fairly long interface names, for example:  
	DSAKeyGen keyGen = 
(DSAKeyGen)KeyGenerator.getKeyGenerator("DSA");

_______________
SECURITY CHANGE - Changed Provider SPI for java.security.Signature
    Initialization 

    The SPI is the Service Provider Interface, which Providers write 
to. 
    There currently are two providers: SUN and JSAFE.

    a) Changed the arguments to two initialization method in Signature
       from (byte[], String) to (Key)
    b) Made one method in key public.
    c) Added a small interface (no implementation): DSAPrivateKey

    Changed java.security.Signature and sun.security.provider.DSA.

_______________
SECURITY CHANGE- API changes to Signature, MessageDigest, and 
    KeyPairGenerator

    Signature
      public Signature get(String algorithm) 	->
      public Signature getInstance(String algorithm)
	
      public Signature get(String algorithm, String provider) ->
      public Signature getInstance(String algorithm, String provider)

    MessageDigest
      public MessageDigest get(String algorithm) ->
      public MessageDigest getInstance(String algorithm)

      public MessageDigest get(String algorithm, String provider) ->
      public MessageDigest getInstance(String algorithm, String 
provider)

    KeyPairGenerator
      public KeyPairGenerator get(String algorithm) ->
      public KeyPairGenerator getInstance(String algorithm)
	
      public KeyPairGenerator get(String algorithm, String provider) ->
      public KeyPairGenerator getInstance(String algorithm, String 
provider)

_______________
SECURITY CHANGE - Changed key generation API

    The change consisted of moving a set of existing methods from 
    Signature to a new KeyPairGenerator class.

    API change:
    a) Moved key generation calls from signature to a new
       KeyPairGenerator class
    b) Added a small DSAKeyPairGenerator interface, which specializes
       behavior for DSA key generation. 

    The change  consisted of moving 3 abstract API methods to a new 
class.
	- defined a KeyGenerator factory method (identical to
	  Signature's).
	- added one line to ths sun.security.provider.DSA class.
	- added one line to ths sun.security.provider.Sun class.
	- updated API clients in JDK (there are two of them).


    RATIONALE:
    Customer feedback makes a strong case for moving the
    Signature class key generation calls into its own class. Key
    generation is currently implemented as part of the Signature
    class. While it provides a uniform, algorithm-independent
    key-generation semantics, it is hard to understand (and therefore 
to
    use). It has confused users both internally and externally.
  
__________
JAR CHANGE - Can now handle compressed JAR files in the CLASSPATH

    java.util.zip.ZipFile was enhanced so that it can now handle 
    compressed ZIP/JAR file entries. No changes to the API were made. 
    With this change, compressed JAR/ZIP files can now be handled
    by javac.

    Additionally, the runtime has also changed so that it can now
    handle compressed ZIP/JAR files that are specified in the 
CLASSPATH.

___________
LANG CHANGE - Removed a constructor and two methods from 
java.lang.Throwable

    - Removed the Throwable(String, Object[]) constructor 
    - Removed the setArguments() method 
    - Removed the getArguments() method 

    RATIONALE:
    The arguments property was originally added to java.lang.Throwable 
for 
    use in the generation of localized messages.  This was deemed 
premature, 
    and so the property was removed in order to avoid tempting 
programmers 
    to use it for some other purpose.

_________
IO CHANGE - Deprecated constructor StreamTokenizer(InputStream)

    This fixed bug 4025998.

    RATIONALE:
    The StreamTokenizer(InputStream) constructor was not 
binary-compatible 
    with JDK 1.0.2.  This constructor was changed in JDK1.1 to convert 
    automatically from bytes to characters using the platform's default
    character encoding, but that change required buffering input data, 
    which breaks binary compatibility.  This change has been removed.

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed the names of VM initialization
and thread-attach structures

    Changed the JDK initialization structure name from JavaVMInitArgs 
to 
    JDK1_1InitArgs to make it clear that it is JDK1.1 specific.

    Similarly, ThreadAttachArgs has changed its name to 
JDK1_1AttachArgs.

    RATIONALE:
    When a native application uses the invocation API to start up
    the VM, it passes the VM an initialization structure. Since in
    general different VM implementations require different 
    initialization information (min/max heap size, native stack size,
    enable debugging, etc.), the JNI spec explicitly says
    that the contents of the structure vary among VM implementations.
    However, the JDK initialization structure, JavaVMInitArgs, gives 
    the wrong impression that it should work with other VMs. This has
    caused confusion on how to implement the JNI without conflicting
    with JDK's naming scheme.

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed NewStringUTF parameters

    Removed the length argument, strlen(s, from NewStringUTF().  The
    signature for this method is now:

	jstring NewStringUTF(JNIEnv *env, const char *s);

    RATIONALE:
    NewStringUTF constructs a Java string from a UTF string. Although 
    UTF strings are already 0-terminated, the function required an
    unnecessary length argument, forcing the programmer to write:

	NewStringUTF(env, s, strlen(s))

    instead of just:

	NewStringUTF(env, s) 

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed DeleteLocalRef and 
DeleteGlobalRef

    Now programmers can pass local or global references to 
DeleteLocalRef 
    and DeleteGlobalRef directly, instead of having to pass the address 
    of these references.

    RATIONALE:
    DeleteLocalRef and DeleteGlobalRef delete local or global 
references
    created by the JNI. They used to take the address of the reference,
    forcing programmers to write:

	DeleteLocalRef(&ref)

    now references are passed as follows:

	DeleteLocalRef(ref)

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed the "IsSubclassOf" function name
    to "IsAssignableFrom."

    RATIONALE:
    The following JNI (Java Native Interface) function was misnamed:

        jboolean IsSubclassOf(JNIEnv *env, jclass clazz1, 
                                           jclass clazz2);

    It did not match the Java Language Specification's definition 
    of the "subclass" relationship.

    The Reflection API has a similar method in java.lang.Class:
	
        boolean isAssignableFrom(Class class);
		
    This is a much more suitable name. The JNI function therefore 
changed 
    its name to:
	
        jboolean IsAssignableFrom(JNIEnv *env, jclass clazz1, 
                                               jclass clazz2);

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Change RegisterNatives so that it
    takes all the information in one array.

    RATIONALE:
    In beta3, the RegisterNatives function took three arrays
    containing native method names, signatures and function entry 
    pointers, respectively:
	
        jint RegisterNatives(JNIEnv env, jclass clazz, 
               const char *names[],
               const char *signatures[];
               void *nativeProcs[]);
		 
    These arrays had to be of the same length, and had to be NULL-
    terminated. It's better to put all the info in a single array,
    and pass the length of the array as another argument:
	
        struct JNINativeMethod {
            char* name;
            char* signature;
            void* fnPtr;
        };
        typedef struct JNINativeMethod JNINativeMethod;

        void RegisterNatives(JNIEnv* env, jclass classID, 
                  const JNINativeMethod methods[], jsize count);

    Here's how code that uses this looks in FCS:

        JNINativeMethodSpec methods[] = {
            { "sin", "(D)D", &::sin },
            { "cos", "(D)D", &::cos },
            { "tan", "(D)D", &::tan }
        };
        env->RegisterNatives(env->FindClass("java/lang/Math"), methods, 
3);

    Here's how the same code used to look in beta3:

        const char* names[] = { "sin", "cos", "tan", NULL };
        const char* signatures[] = { "(D)D", "(D)D", "(D)D", NULL };
        void* procs[] = { &::sin, &::cos, &::tan, NULL };
        env->RegisterNatives(env->FindClass("java/lang/Math"), 
                             names, signatures, proc);
	
    The former approach is clearer.

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed the typing scheme of references
    to Java objects.

    In JDK Beta 3, reference types are defined as follows:

    typedef void *jref;    /* generic type for references */
    typedef jref jobject;  /* Java objects */
    typedef jref jclass;   /* Java class objects */
    typedef jref jstring;  /* Java strings */
    typedef jref jarray;   /* Java arrays */

    The distinction between jref and jobject was not clear. In 1.1 FCS,
    we got rid of jref, and introduced additional reference types to 
more
    accurately convey the subtyping information. We introduced dummy 
C++
    classes to enforce the subtyping relationships:

    #ifdef __cplusplus

    class _jobject {};
    class _jclass : public _jobject {};
    class _jthrowable : public _jobject {};
    class _jstring : public _jobject {};
    class _jarray : public _jobject {};
    class _jbooleanArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jbyteArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jcharArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jshortArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jintArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jlongArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jfloatArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jdoubleArray : public _jarray {};
    class _jobjectArray : public _jarray {};

    typedef _jobject *jobject;
    typedef _jclass *jclass;
    typedef _jthrowable *jthrowable;
    typedef _jstring *jstring;
    typedef _jarray *jarray;
    typedef _jbooleanArray *jbooleanArray;
    typedef _jbyteArray *jbyteArray;
    typedef _jcharArray *jcharArray;
    typedef _jshortArray *jshortArray;
    typedef _jintArray *jintArray;
    typedef _jlongArray *jlongArray;
    typedef _jfloatArray *jfloatArray;
    typedef _jdoubleArray *jdoubleArray;
    typedef _jobjectArray *jobjectArray;

    #else

    struct _jobject;

    typedef struct _jobject *jobject;
    typedef jobject jclass;
    typedef jobject jthrowable;
    typedef jobject jstring;
    typedef jobject jarray;
    typedef jarray jbooleanArray;
    typedef jarray jbyteArray;
    typedef jarray jcharArray;
    typedef jarray jshortArray;
    typedef jarray jintArray;
    typedef jarray jlongArray;
    typedef jarray jfloatArray;
    typedef jarray jdoubleArray;
    typedef jarray jobjectArray;

    #endif

    JNI function types have been modified accordingly to accept or 
return
    the newly introduced reference types.

____________________________
JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE CHANGE - Changed the typing of certain primitive
    types:

    The following types in earlier versions of JDK:

    typedef char jboolean;
    typedef char jbyte;
    typedef unsigned long jsize;

    have been changed to:

    typedef unsigned char jboolean;
    typedef signed char jbyte;
    typedef jint jsize;

    in JDK 1.1 FCS.

    Earlier, jsize was defined to be an unsigned integer type that has
    the same number of bits as a native pointer. The idea was to use
    jsize to represent array length and size, etc. However, there has
    been a great deal of confusion on what operations are available 
    on jsize, whether it is safe to convert jsize to int, etc. We
    changed jsize to be the same as jint because Java arrays and
    strings cannot be longer than 2^31 anyway. All standard Java
    methods that operate on arrays and strings use "int" as the
    length and size types.

___________
TOOL CHANGE - New argument -s added to javap

    -s: Print method and field type signature information in the 
internal
        form used by the Java Virtual Machine.  This is the form 
through
        which a user of the Java Native Interface (JNI) refers to 
methods
        and fields. Using javap with the -s flag to print method and 
field
        information for a class to be accessed with the JNI avoids the 
        difficulty of constructing signatures in the obscure internal 
        format manually.
    
    Examples of use:

    % cat foo.java
    class foo {
        Thread thread;
        int i;
        public static void main(String args[]) {
        }
        private void foo() {}
    }

    % javap -p foo
    Compiled from foo.java
    class foo extends java.lang.Object 
        /* ACC_SUPER bit set */ 
    {
        java.lang.Thread thread;
        int i;
        public static void main(java.lang.String []);
        private void foo();
        foo();
    }

    % javap -p -s foo
    Compiled from foo.java
    class foo extends java.lang.Object 
        /* ACC_SUPER bit set */
    {
        thread Ljava/lang/Thread;
        i I
        public static main ([Ljava/lang/String;)V
        private foo ()V
        <init> ()V
    }

___________
TOOL CHANGE - Added -deprecation flag to javac

    By default, when compiling a class that contains deprecated APIs, 
    javac now displays only a brief note, rather than immediately
    listing all of the deprecated APIs.  For example:

    % javac MyClass.java
    Note: MyClass.java uses deprecated APIs.  Recompile with 
"-deprecation" 
    for details.

    Then, you can re-compile using the -deprecation flag to get the
    name of the deprecated constructor, field, method, class or 
    interface.

    % javac -deprecation MyClass.java
    MyClass.java:3: Note: The constructor java.lang.String(byte[],int)
    has been deprecated.
        new String(new byte[0], 0);
        ^
    Note: wombat.java uses deprecated APIs.  Please consult the 
    documentation for a better alternative.

    At this point, please refer to the JDK API Reference documentation
    (the javadoc-generated web pages) jdk1.1/docs/api/packages.html.
    If you look up the deprecated API, it should give you more details
    such as which API replaces it.    

    To summarize the compiler options:
        javac -nowarn       => complete silence
        javac               => a one-line comment about deprecations
        javac -deprecation  => a full report

    RATIONALE:
    This can greatly reduce the amount of warning by default, allowing 
    developers to concentrate on the errors, and to have a graceful
    migration towards updating their deprecated code.

 
===================================================================
Changes from JDK 1.1beta2 to JDK 1.1beta3
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes and bug fixes are in the JDK 1.1beta3 release.

______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is 
"JDK1.1beta3.3". 

    Versions beta3.1 and beta3.2 were internal candidates that were 
    never released.
    You can get the version number of your particular release by 
executing:

        java -version

_______________
PACKAGE CHANGES - Two new packages in java.*: java.beans and java.math
    Changes in these packages are described in more detail below.

________________
JAVABEANS CHANGE - JavaBeans1.0 is now part of JDK1.1
    The classes that define the JavaBeans 1.0 API specification
    are now part of JDK1.1.  These classes are part of BDK1.0
    beta1 and beta2; there will be a BDK1.0beta3 that synchronizes
    with JDK1.1beta3.

  - There has been one change in the JavaBeans APIs: the string
    argument to Beans.instantiate() has changed. The argument
    used to be the path to a serialized bean, it is now the
    name of a bean, which may be serialized, or just a class name.

______________
GENERAL CHANGE - Extended the core API methods that take a PrintStream 
    argument so they can also take a PrintWriter argument.

    Several constructors and methods have been added to make the 
    new PrintWriter class easier to use.  

_________
IO CHANGE - Merged the functionality of the ByteToCharConverter 
    and CharToByteConverter classes into the InputStreamReader and
    OutputStreamWriter classes.

    The ByteToCharConverter and CharToByteConverter classes 
    are no longer public, so various constructors and methods
    that previously took converter arguments now accept names
    of character encodings.  The InputStreamReader and 
    OutputStreamWriter classes no longer commit to buffering
    the underlying byte stream.  Details on these and other
    changes may be found at:

    http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/guide/io/b3-changes.html

___________
LANG CHANGE - New method: identityHashCode in java.lang.System

    Its signature is:

    public static native int identityHashCode(Object x);

    It returns the same hashcode for the given object as
    would be returned by the default method hashCode(),
    whether or not the given object's class overrides hashCode().
    The hashcode for the null reference is zero.

    RATIONALE:  
    In previous releases, Java lacked a constant-time
    identity hash function.  This meant there was no way to build
    a hash table which keyed on object identity, and for which
    access would be a constant-time operation.

    Java supplied a constant-time identity comparison operation 
    (the built-in operator ==) but did not supply a corresponding
    constant-time identity hash operation.

    This new method is very useful when the object in question does
    override equals and hashCode, but the guts of some abstraction
    is working with canonicalized instances, such as interned 
    strings, and needs to use them as keys for fast lookups.

    Although this is sometimes done by wrapping the string-like
    object inside another object which does not override equals 
    and hashCode, it's desirable to allow such objects to be used
    directly as keys in identity tables, to avoid the overhead 
    of allocating the wrappers.

    When performance is not an issue, the method Object.hashCode() 
    suffices, even if it is slow (as with strings), but when
    performance must be maximized, neither the wrapper technique 
    nor the slow hashCode() method is workable, and only a fast
    identityHashCode() method will be suitable.

___________
LANG CHANGE - getResourceAsName(String) changed to getResource(String)

    java.lang.Class and java.lang.ClassLoader used to have methods 
    with signature:

       String getResourceAsName(String)

    which would return an external representation to a URL to
    the desired resource file.  These methods have been replaced
    by methods with signature

       java.net.URL getResource(String)

    which return the actual URL (or null if the resource is not found).

___________
AWT CHANGES - New type of event: ContainerEvent

  This change provides the hooks for containers to easily register 
event 
  listeners on descendents.
 
  - Added new ContainerEvent class and equivalent ContainerListener 
    interface to enable notification when components are added/removed
    from containers.  This makes it relatively easy for containers 
    to register themselves as listeners for events on all of their 
    descendents.

  - Added the addContainerListener/removeContainerListener methods
    to Container.

  RATIONALE:
  In beta2 the event model provided no reasonable mechanism
  to allow containers to get input events which occurred in their
  descendents, which turns out to be a fairly common need.
  The 1.0 event model allowed this by automatically propagating
  events up the containment hierarchy until some component returned
  "true" to absorb the event and stop the propagation.  While this
  seems powerful (and it's easy), the 1.0 propagation model is error
  prone and results in poor performance. 
     
___________
AWT CHANGES - Further Fine-Tuning of AWT Input Event Related API

  Responding to customer feedback and testing, we made the following
  changes to the API in the java.awt and java.awt.event packages:

  - Added a TextEvent class and TextListener interface to enable
    programs to track all changes to a text component, including
    paste and programmatic modifications.  (Bug #4014945)

  - Added new windowActivated/windowDeactivated event types to 
WindowEvent 
    to enable programs to determine when a window gets/loses focus.
  
  - Added isTemporary method to FocusEvent to enable determining the
    difference between when focus is explicitly moved between 
components
    and when focus temporarily changes (such as when a window is
    de-activated).
  
  - Added a consume method to the InputEvent class, enabling any object
    to consume input events.  Previously, only the Component associated
    with the input event could consume it.

  - Made the AWTEventMulticaster class public, enabling component
    subclasses to serve as multicast sources for AWT-defined events.
  
  - Made the java.awt.event Adapter classes abstract so that it's clear
    that they need to be extended.

  - Removed constructors in java.awt.event Event classes that took
    an old 1.0 event as a parameter.
  
  - Changed the event id values of the ComponentEvent types to prevent 
them
    from clashing with the WindowEvent ids.
  
  - Added virtual keycode identifiers to KeyEvent to properly represent
    all standard keys on the keyboard.  The keyCode property of the key
    event now contains one of those identifiers (instead of the ASCII
    integer equivalent).

  - Added a method called isPopupTrigger to the MouseEvent class,
    providing a platform-independent way to determine whether a mouse
    event should result in a popup menu being shown. (Bug #4017794)

__________
AWT CHANGE - New method: getTreeLock() to java.awt.Component:

    The public field Component.LOCK will NOT be changed for beta3,
    to minimize the risk of the change for beta3, but it will be made
    non-public (package private) between beta3 and final release.

    RATIONALE:
    The AWT exposes a public static final field, called Component.LOCK, 
    for synchronizing operations that affect or depend on
    component-tree structure.  

    Exposing this field for public use unnecessarily constricts future
    AWT implementations to providing a single toolkit-wide lock.

    It is much better to provide access to the lock object by an
    instance method on class Component, such that future
    implementations can return a context-sensitive locking object if
    they need to.

__________
AWT CHANGE - New Component method: getLocationOnScreen

    Added one new method to the Component class:

      Point getLocationOnScreen()

    RATIONALE:
    This method returns the current location of the component in
    the screen's coordinate space.

__________
AWT CHANGE - New Choice method: insert

    Added one new method to the Choice class:

      void insert(String item, int index) 

    RATIONALE:
    This method lets you insert items into a Choice control at the 
index
    you specify.  (In Beta2, items were always added at the end.)

__________
AWT CHANGE - ItemSelectable interface change 

    Removed the following two methods from the ItemSelectable 
interface:
       public int[] getSelectedIndexes();
       public String[] getSelectedItems();

    They have been replaced by the following method:
       public Object[] getSelectedObjects();

    RATIONALE:
    This change removes the restriction that an item must be 
representable
    by a String.  The AWT classes that implement ItemSelectable (List,
    Choice, Checkbox, and CheckboxMenuItem) have changed accordingly.

__________
AWT CHANGE - Allow Container and Component classes to be extended 
    directly to create lightweight components.

  1) Added the following method to java.awt.Component

	Dimension getMaximumSize();

     In beta2 components could specify only their minimum and preferred
     sizes and assume that the component was infinitely stretchable.  
     This assumption is invalid with lightweight components where 
components
     tend to be written at a finer granularity and some components 
don't
     want to be flexible.

     The default implementation of this method specifies infinite
     size to reflect the current behavior.

  2) Added two alignment functions to java.awt.Component.

        float getAlignmentX();
	float getAlignmentY();

     that return a number between 0.0 and 1.0.  These values specify 
how 
     to align the component relative to other components.  0.0 would be
     aligned at the origin, 1.0 the furthest away from the origin, 
     0.5 is centered, etc.  As examples, a text component would have a
     y alignment to the baseline, and an icon component would have 
     an alignment to its hotspot, if defined.

    RATIONALE:
    Before beta3 the only way of creating new components in the AWT was
    to extend Canvas, Panel, and their subclasses.  Component and
    Container could not be directly extended.  All components were
    automatically "heavyweight" in that each had an opaque native
    window associated with them.  The problem with this is that 
heavyweight
    components are expensive (you can't afford to have too many) and
    they cannot have any transparent pixels.  The new changes create
    standard support for lightweight components.

____________
MATH CHANGES - New package: java.math, which initially contains two 
    classes:  BigInteger and BigDecimal.

    BigNum class has been removed and replaced by BigInteger and 
BigDecimal.

    BigIntegers are immutable arbitrary-precision integers, which 
provide
    analogs to all of Java's primitive integer operators, and all 
relevant
    static methods from java.lang.Math.  Additionally, BigIntegers 
provide
    operations for modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality 
testing, 
    prime generation, single-bit manipulation, and a few other odds and 
ends.

    BigDecimals are immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal 
numbers,
    suitable for monetary calculations.  BigDecimals provide operations 
for 
    basic arithmetic, scale manipulation, comparison, format conversion 
    and hashing.  The BigDecimal class gives its user complete control 
    over rounding behavior, forcing the user to explicitly specify a 
    rounding behavior for operations capable of discarding precision.

________________
SECURITY CHANGES -  New method: getProviders(), which provides 
    a way to query which crypto providers are installed.
 
    This method is added to the Security class and has the form:
 
	public static String[] getProviders();

___________
TOOL CHANGE - javakey is now able to export keys and certs
    to files.

    This is a change to the javakey tool, a reciprocal to
    the existing import facility.

___________
TOOL CHANGE - javac -nowarn flag now suppresses @deprecated messages  

    This can greatly reduce the amount of messages, allowing you
    to see only the errors.

____________
TOOL CHANGES - jar tool is incompatible with earlier JAR files

    The beta3 jar tool (more specifically, ZipInputStream and
    ZipOutputStream) is incompatible with JAR files created with
    the beta2 jar tool.  The JAR tool won't understand those files.
    There was a bug in beta2 ZipInputStream and ZipOutputStream 
    such that those classes didn't generate files properly according
    to the zip specification (one bit out of place means a lot...)
    The bug was fixed and now it generates proper zip files that 
    other tools will understand.

____________
TOOL CHANGES - Removed ability to generate MIF from javadoc

    Removed "-doctype MIF" option from javadoc.  This was necessary
    in order to remove the HTML parser dependency that HotJava had
    on the JDK.

===================================================================
Changes from the original JDK 1.1beta to JDK 1.1beta2
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following fixes and improvements are in the JDK 1.1beta2 release.

______________
VERSION NUMBER - The version number for this release is "JDK1.1beta2". 

    You can get the version number of your particular release by 
executing:

        java -version

_______
CHANGE - Source code for public classes included

    The source code for the public classes in the java.* package are 
    now included in this release in the file src.zip.  These correspond
    to the public classes contained in classes.zip.  This src.zip
    is equivalent to that shipped previously with JDK 1.0.2
    but also includes sources to the new public classes added in JDK 
1.1. 

_______
BUG FIX - Jar tool manifest-build limitation on number of files on 
Solaris

    DESCRIPTION OF BUG
    In some configurations of Solaris, trying to create a JAR file 
    that has more than 64 entries in it would fail.  The command 
    that would cause this to happen is:

    % jar cvf test.jar <somedir>
  
    where <somedir> is a directory containing more than 64 files.

    SOLUTION - This bug has been fixed.

_______
BUG FIX - Javakey tool signs jar files with invalid signatures

    DESCRIPTION OF BUG
    An implementation inconsistency in the javakey security tool causes
    jar files to be signed with invalid signatures. This means that 
    signature checking will always fail, thus all applets will run as 
    untrusted, with minimal permissions enabled.  This makes code 
signing
    feature unusable but it is not a security hole.  

    SOLUTION - This bug has been fixed. 

_______
BUG FIX - 4017054 - Limit to numeric range of case statements
 
    DESCRIPTION OF BUG
    If a Java switch statement includes case statements that cover a 
wide
    range of numerical values (although not necessarily a large number 
of 
    cases themselves), the Java compiler can run out of memory 
attempting 
    to compile that statement.  For instance, a switch statement 
    containing the two cases 0 and 99999999 will cause the compiler to 
    run out of memory.
 
    SOLUTION - This bug has been fixed.

_______
BUG FIX - 4018832 - Missing class java.io.LineNumberReader

    DESCRIPTION OF BUG
    In the Win32 release, the class java.io.LineNumberReader is
    documented but the class file is absent from classes.zip

    SOLUTION - java.io.LineNumberReader has been added to classes.zip

_______
BUG FIX - 4018252 - DecimalNumberFormat methods throw exceptions

    DESCRIPTION OF BUG
    The class java.text.DecimalNumberFormat throws an exception when 
any 
    of its format or parse methods are called.  A typical stack trace 
    looks something like the following:

    java.lang.NumberFormatException: 451.0D
        at java.lang.Double.<init>(Double.java)
        at java.text.DigitList.getRealDouble(DigitList.java)
        at java.text.DigitList.set(DigitList.java)
        at java.text.DecimalFormat.format(DecimalFormat.java)
        at java.text.NumberFormat.format(NumberFormat.java)

    Although DecimalNumberFormats are generally not used directly, they 
    are returned by calls to NumberFormat.getDefault(), 
    NumberFormat.getDefaultCurrency() and 
NumberFormat.getDefaultPercent().

    SOLUTION - This bug has been fixed.
